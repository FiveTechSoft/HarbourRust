# Experimental LLVM scalar AOT gate

This branch is a feasibility test, not a replacement backend. Default `hbc`
behavior is unchanged. `--experimental-llvm` uses the same preprocessor, parser
and semantic/ownership checks, then emits LLVM IR for a deliberately small
scalar subset. LLVM verifies, optimizes and emits an object, linked with the
existing assembly runtime through target-C-ABI adapters. No JIT, VM or new
ownership/collection representation is introduced.

## Status and boundaries

Supported for this experiment: I64 function signatures/locals, integer + - *,
signed comparisons, IF, WHILE, FOR with its existing signed overflow termination,
user calls/recursion, lazy IIF, integer output and literal string output. Arithmetic
uses ordinary LLVM wrapping operations, never invented `nsw`/`nuw` promises.
FOR increment uses signed-overflow intrinsic and keeps the old counter on overflow.
Everything else is rejected by the existing checker or experimental emitter.
This is not full Harbour integer-promotion semantics beyond the current backend.

Not implemented: arrays, dynamic values, floats, owned strings, byref ABI,
EXIT/LOOP, most builtins including ProcLine, logical output, native Windows
compiler packaging, and per-statement diagnostic trace parity. The prototype
therefore cannot pass the full compatibility battery through LLVM. The normal
(nonexperimental) path passes 1081 manifest cases plus five harness checks on
Linux and Wine, with the frozen sweep unchanged at 20 COMPILES.

Diagnostic trace updates in the current backend are not emitted by the LLVM
path yet. Successful-output equality does not establish error-trace equality.
Do not replace the current backend or claim general Rust parity from these tests.

## Reproduce

Requirements: Rust, GNU binutils, Python3, an LLVM23 shared library exposing the
C API. Set `HARBOUR_LLVM_LIB` to that library and run:

```
bash experiments/llvm-scalar/run.sh
```

Optionally set `RUSTC`, `M` (MinGW bin dir), `MLIB` (MinGW import libraries),
`WINE` and its normal environment. Windows tests are cross-generated and run
under Wine, not native Windows. Run output is ignored by git. No automatic
installation or network download occurs. LLVM shared-library path is explicit;
the rustc-distribution C API used in this test is not a stable packaging contract.
The driver assumes LLVM23, X86 target, x86-64 baseline CPU, small code model,
static relocation and `default<O3>`. It fails if the required API is missing.

## Evidence, 27 October 2026

Environment: Linux x86-64, virtual Intel Xeon 2.60GHz, two visible CPUs;
rustc1.99.1 and LLVM23.1.1. Scalar corpus: accumulation, conditional accumulation,
recursive factorial and integer recurrence. Full corpus and edge-case output
match the current backend on Linux and Wine. Edge cases include negative steps,
zero-trip loops, lazy IIF and signed FOR counter overflow termination.
3063 scalar differential calls cover arguments -12..1000 and factorial -3..20.
Five print-adapter calls and a recursive LLVM call pass GPR/stack canaries on
Linux and GPR/stack/XMM6-15 canaries under Wine. No native-Windows result is claimed.

Kernel-only timings below are medians of 31 rotating-order samples after three
warmup rounds. Dynamic inputs cross a non-inlined function boundary; all results
are consumed. Rust uses matching wrapping arithmetic and checked FOR-counter
increment, with x86-64 baseline target and optimization3. This is a shared host,
not a dedicated benchmark machine. No confidence interval or general speed claim.

| Kernel | Existing backend | LLVM prototype | Rust equivalent |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Sum, 1M iterations | 2.453ms | 0.303ms | 0.303ms |
| Branch, 1M iterations | 3.342ms | 0.766ms | 0.763ms |
| Recurrence, 1M iterations | 3.146ms | 0.799ms | 0.929ms |

These current-backend times include its diagnostic trace updates, unlike the
other two. An explicitly labeled assembly-only no-trace control still showed
large scalar gaps, but layout/timing noise means subtracting the runs is not a
valid estimate of tracing cost. Raw samples and that control are in `results/`.
Factorial10 is only ~4ns in LLVM/Rust and ~71ns current, too small and narrow for
a headline; function/dispatch overhead matters. No vectorization, real application,
array/string workload, memory profile or Windows speed result is established.
LLVM scalar assembly keeps loop state in registers, removes local stack traffic,
and optimizes recursion; optimized Rust shows similar scalar patterns. A constant
whole-program case can eliminate its loop. Those are local findings, not a claim
that every Harbour program will have Rust-quality code.

| Same complete corpus executable | Current | LLVM prototype |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Linux file bytes | 22040 | 24816 |
| Windows file bytes | 20524 | 20788 |
| Linux stripped file bytes | 18392 | 21000 |

Linux LLVM executable has no dynamic section; Windows imports only KERNEL32.dll.
LLVM is not inside those programs. File size is not RSS: runtime data/BSS still
exists. The library used by the development driver is 208167760 bytes, external
to every generated executable. Compiler-with-LLVM distribution size is unmeasured.
The current Rust compiler frontend binary is ~5.7MB; that does not include the
external LLVM library. No universal size prediction follows from this corpus.

Full small-corpus Linux pipelines measured across 11 runs: current median12ms
(frontend, assembler, linker), prototype median91ms (frontend, Python driver,
LLVM load/optimization/object, adapter preparation, assembler, linker). These
include Python startup/library load, not an intrinsic LLVM-only compilation cost.
Original raw samples and generated assembly are preserved in `results/`.

## Decision

Promising evidence for a separate LLVM route on scalar compute, without forcing
large generated executables. Not evidence to migrate now. Next gates would be
trace/error parity, larger runtime/data workloads, robust dependency packaging,
full differential correctness and actual Windows validation. Any expansion of
ownership/representation or replacement of the backend remains a separate decision.
